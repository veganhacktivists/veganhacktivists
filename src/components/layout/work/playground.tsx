              Playground was our response to meet the overwhelming demand of
              tech and design support in our movement, while staying sustainable
              as an organization with limited capacity. We prioritized
              automating the process of connecting organizations with technical,
              design, and other support needs with skilled volunteers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond design and software development, these volunteers are
              professionals with a wide array of skills and backgrounds in data
              science, videography, marketing, security, research, and much
              more.
