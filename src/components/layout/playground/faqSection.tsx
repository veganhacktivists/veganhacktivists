          Playground is a community of passionate vegan volunteers looking to
          support animal advocates and organizations by volunteering their time
          and skills. Their diverse skill sets include software development,
          design, content creation, marketing, and much more. Anyone can join
          this community and apply to help you with your request.

          Playground is separate from the Vegan Hacktivists team, and aims to
          increase the capacity in which we can support your work for the
          animals.

          If you have a specific project or operational need in mind, click on
          &ldquo;Submit a request&rdquo; and fill out the form to let us know
          exactly what you need help with. We&apos;ll review your request to
          make sure it fits our community standards, and then approve or decline
          it. If approved, you will get an email confirming when your request is
          live and public. Then all you have to do is wait for volunteers to
          apply! We&apos;ll review all applications, vet them, and then approve

          includes checking their LinkedIn, portfolio, resume, past work, and
          social media profiles. Depending on the request, we may also interview
          the applicant by phone or email.
