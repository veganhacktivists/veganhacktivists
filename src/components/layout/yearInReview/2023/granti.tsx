We tackled this issue head-on by building a tool that would allow better management and facilitation of grants for both advocates and funders alike. We were thrilled to onboard the first funders onto the platform, and publicly announced its launch at the end of the year!<no-localization>{break}{break}</no-localization>Grantees often struggle to keep track of their grant submissions, both current and past. Funders face similar challenges, as it's rare to have all the necessary information in one easy-to-understand and accessible format.

Our system, <no-localization>Granti</no-localization>, brings everyone together, simplifying the grant process for all.<no-localization>{break}{break}</no-localization>Since its launch, <no-localization>Granti</no-localization> has made a huge impact, helping distribute tens of millions of dollars. <no-localization>Granti</no-localization> makes everything easierâ€”from handling applications to updating records and managing finances.
