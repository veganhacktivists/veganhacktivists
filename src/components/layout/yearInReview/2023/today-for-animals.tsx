Participants in the app earn recognition and climb the leaderboard as they complete tasks. They can also collect beautifully crafted badges for their profiles and maintain a daily activity streak by checking into the app each day. This gamified approach keeps our community engaged and helps everyone continuously contribute to animal advocacy.<no-localization>{break}{break}</no-localization>The launch of this project was met with great reception, and garnered 269 sign ups just within a couple of weeks. But we didnâ€™t stop there! Our team is consistently improving the app, to keep the users curious, active, and motivated to make a difference even in the most mundane.<no-localization>{break}{break}</no-localization><b>Have you helped the animals today?</b>',
