We focused significantly on the internal workings and processes of our organization, while also doing our best to serve organizations and advocates. We launched technology using machine learning and artificial intelligence, and we delivered new features and upgrades to high-impact projects. We attended conferences, spoke on podcasts, and created meaningful connections to expand our reach and impact. We launched the first study of its kind to collect data on the state of tech in the movement, and we partnered with 10 unique organizations in the animal protection movement on various initiatives. There is so much that weâ€™ve done behind the scenes, and there is so much more to come. We are excited to be on this journey with all of you.'
