            What a year! We wanted to focus on data-based efforts while staying
            true to our spirit of experimental projects, and we were able to
            achieve those goals through Activist Hub and Vegan Linguists. This
            has truly been the best year for creating connections and
            partnerships in the animal protection movement, and we are extremely
            pleased with the work we&apos;ve accomplished.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, we have also prioritized organizing and optimizing
            internal processes. This was crucial for us since a core focus of
            2022 is to expand our volunteer network to meet the demand of our
            services. We want to continue being able to serve the multifaceted
            needs of the vegan movement and empower people to become activists.
          </p>
