      <p>
        We surveyed over {formatNumber(1100)} animal rights activists to
        understand what tools would best support their advocacy. The number one
        request was a method of monitoring our effectiveness in order to make
        informed decisions about our strategy and future efforts. So, we created
        Activist Hub!
      </p>
      <p>
        Activist Hub is an online tool that allows activists to see how many
        people they have inspired to watch documentaries, to take a vegan
        challenge, and have gone vegan!
      </p>
      <p>
        Activist Hub also acts as the world’s first animal rights social
        network! Add friends, join groups, share or create posts, strategize and
        talk with other activists. Our hub is 100% free to use for any
        individual or organization advocating on behalf of animals.

      <p>
        Every day, more and more people from around the world are being
        digitally connected.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has become increasingly important to translate online vegan content
        to reach more people. Vegan Linguists is a free content translation
        service run by vegans, for vegans. We translate vegan-content to help
        make veganism more accessible worldwide! All you need to do is sign up
        and submit your content—or volunteer as a translator, for the animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are proud to have worked and launched with Animal Ethics,
        Faunalytics, Peace Advocacy Network, Sinergia Animal, among many others.

      <p>
        Watch three thought-provoking movies that shed light on uncomfortable
        realities, and explore other resources for support!
      </p>
      <p>
        This project allows you to create your own landing page with vegan
        documentaries, videos, resources, challenges, and more, to share with
        friends, family, or online - and then track all of the clicks and watch
        time you get.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your 3 Movies link is the only link you&apos;ll ever need to share
        during your outreach!

  'Watch Dominion': (

      <p>
        Watch Dominion provides easy multi-language access to the most promoted
        documentary in the vegan movement, Dominion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watch Dominion also allows other organizations to embed Dominion
        (without age restrictions or worries of it being taken down) on their
        own website while collecting watch-time statistics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anonymous for the Voiceless, DontWatch.org, Viena Animal Save, and many
        others use this project now for uninterrupted access.
