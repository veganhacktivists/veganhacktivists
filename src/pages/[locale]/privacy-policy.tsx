      <h2 className='text-3xl mt-8 mb-4'>2. Use of Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use the information we collect about you or that you provide to us,
        including any personal information, for various purposes, including:
      </p>
      <ul className='py-4 pl-8'>

        Vegan Hacktivists is committed to respecting the privacy of its
        financial and in-kind donors, whether the donation is made online, by
        mail, or any other method. When you make a financial or in-kind
        donation, you provide your name and contact information and in many
        instances, standard payment information such as credit card data is
        provided. We protect your information in a variety of ways, by utilizing
        industry standard safeguards to protect your information, such as
        encryption, access controls, network firewalls, and physical security.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-4'>
        These measures make it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept the
        credit card information you send to us. When we work with other
        companies to process credit card transactions, those companies also
        utilize encryption and other appropriate security measures. We will not
        sell, share or trade our donors’ personally identifiable information
        with any other entity, except as described below.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we will not send mailings to our donors on behalf of other
        organizations, unless a donor has given us specific permission to do so.
        We have vendors that assist with processing and managing donations and
        donor data. We give these vendors access to donor data. Our vendors are
        bound by strict confidentiality rules and are permitted to use donor
        data only to support Vegan Hacktivist operations.
      </p>
      <h2 className='text-3xl mt-8 mb-4'>3. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may share the information we have collected about you in certain
        situations with our trusted consultants but we NEVER SELL YOUR
        INFORMATION FOR COMMERCIAL GAIN. Your information may be disclosed as
        follows:
      </p>
      <ul className='py-4 pl-8'>
        <li className='list-disc'>
          <span className='font-bold'>By Law or to Protect Rights:</span>
          <span>

            necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy
            potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights,
            property, and safety of others.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li className='list-disc'>
          <span className='font-bold'>Third-Party Service Providers:</span>
          <span>
            &nbsp;We may share your information with third-party service
            providers that perform services for us or on our behalf, including
            payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services,
            customer service, and marketing assistance.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className='text-3xl mt-8 mb-4'>4. Security of Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help
        protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps
        to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware
        that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or
        impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed
        against any interception or other type of misuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        We protect the security of credit card transactions using a number of
        measures such as encryption, access controls, network firewalls, and
        physical security. These measures make it extremely difficult for anyone
        to intercept the credit card information you send to us. When we work
        with other companies to process credit card transactions, those
        companies also use encryption and other appropriate security measures.
