            Our mission is to build new, data-driven, disruptive, and innovative
            projects to help end animal exploitation. We believe the animal
            rights movement has four fundamental areas it can improve on that we
            aim to solve through our work.

          <SubSection header="We need more data in our movement.">
            We can’t realistically track or be confident that the projects and
            organizations out there right now are as effective as they can be.
            We strongly believe this is the largest issue in growing our
            movement, and so we aim to build, utilize, and gather data through
            our projects and network – and then share that data.
          </SubSection>
          <SubSection header="We need more competition, too.">
            We strongly believe competition is not only healthy but vital in
            growing and improving our movements’ effectiveness. Competition puts
            heat on other organizations and projects to keep building,
            improving, and innovating – and gives them more data on what works,
            and what doesn’t work.
          </SubSection>
          <SubSection header="We need more innovation and collaboration.">
            We believe the movement has a lot of room and potential to be more
            innovative in its approaches. We aim to help organizations and
            activists by giving them the network and tools to promote more
            collaboration, and utilize their massive networks to help each other
            with pressure campaigns, data evaluation, etc.

          <SubSection header="We need more vegans to become active.">
            Only a tiny percentage of the world is vegan, and a fraction within
            are active. Most organizations focus on converting vegans whether
            through health, environmental, or ethical reasons. We believe that
            we can be more effective by creating tools to help, inspire, and
            motivate more vegans to become activists.
